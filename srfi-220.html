<p>by John Cowan (text), Arvydas Silanskas (implementation)</p>

<h2 id="status">Status</h2>

The editor will add this section.

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

This is a set of convenience routines for generators and accumulators
intended to blend in with
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-158/srfi-158.html">SRFI 158</a>.
This SRFI recommends that they be added to the
<code>(srfi 158)</code> library provided by
users or implementations.
If they are approved by the R7RS-large process,
they can also be added to <code>(r7rs generator)</code>.

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

None at present.

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>The procedures of this SRFI, in cooperation with those
of SRFI 158, make it easier to set up and make use of
pipelines of generators.
In particular, the <code>gchain-generators</code> procedure
allows the creation of just such a pipeline, starting with an
initial generator and adding generator operations to it
to produce a desired result.<p>

<p>The <code>accumulate-generated-values</code>
procedure captures the output of a generator
and passes it directly to an accumulator
until the generator is exhausted.  The
generator can be a <code>gchain-generators</code> chain,
which allows arbitrary transformations.</p>

<p>The <code>gdelete-duplicates</code> procedure is an enhancement
of the SRFI 158 procedure <code>gdelete-neighbor-dups</code>
that can delete duplicates without requiring them to be adjacent results.<p>

<p>The <code>genumerate</code> procedure attaches increasing
non-negative exact integers to the outputs of a generator.
Filtering the stream will still allow the original indices
to be recovered at a later stage.</p>

<p>The procedure <code>gpeek</code> makes generators "peekable" in the sense of
<code>peek-char</code> and <code>peek-u8</code>,
and even "pokeable" in the sense of C's <code>ungetc()</code>.
This partly assimilates them to character or byte ports.</p>

<p>The <code>gchoice</code> operation uses one generator to dictate
which one of a number of other generators will be drawn on to
provide the next value.  If used with the
<code>make-categorical-generator</code> procedure of
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-194/srfi-194.html">SRFI 194</a>
as the first argument, it can choose from the other generators
using a weighted probability.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>stream->generator</code>
and <code>generator->stream</code> allow
conversion between generators and
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-41/srfi-41.html">SRFI 41</a> streams,
and indirectly between streams and
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-127/srfi-127.html">SRFI 127</a> lazy sequences,
which are either lists or improper lists
with a generator in their tails.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p><code>(gchain-generators </code><em>constructor</em> <em>operation</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Creates a generator from a generator constructor plus
a chain of generator operations.  The first argument is
called with no arguments, the remaining arguments with
one argument.
For example, <code>(gchain-generators gmake gfoo gbar)</code> returns the same
generator as <code>(gbar (gfoo (gmake)))</code>.</p>
<p>Since it is typically necessary to pass additional arguments to the
constructor and the operations, the arguments to <code>gchain-generator</code>
will usually be lambda expressions.  For example:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>(gchain-generators
  (lambda () (make-iota-generator 100))
  (lambda (g) (gfilter even? g))
  (lambda (g) (ggroup 5 g)))
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>returns a generator that outputs the values
<code>(0 2 4 6 8)</code>, <code>(10 12 14 16 18)</code>, ... <code>(90 92 94 96 98)</code>.
Such calls can be written more compactly using the <code>cut</code> macro from
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-26/srfi-26.html" rel="nofollow">SRFI 26</a>:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>(gchain-generators
  (cut make-iota-generator 100)
  (cut gfilter even? &lt;&gt;)
  (cut ggroup 5 &lt;&gt;))
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p><code>(accumulate-generated-values
</code><em>accumulator generator</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Invokes <em>generator</em>, passing the value
it returns to <em>accumulator</em>.  If the value was an end-of-file
object, <code>accumulate-generated-values</code> returns whatever the
accumulator returned.  Otherwise, the process is repeated.</p>
<p><code>(gdelete-duplicates </code><em>gen</em> [ = ]<code>)</code></p>
<p>Creates a generator that returns whatever gen returns, except for any items
that are equal to an earlier item in the sense of =, which defaults to <code>equal?</code>.
The = predicate is passed exactly two arguments,
of which the first was generated by gen before the second.</p>  Example:
<blockquote><pre><code>(generator-&gt;list (gdelete-duplicates (list-&gt;generator '(a a b c a a a d c))))
  ⇒ (a b c d)
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p><code>(genumerate </code><em>gen</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Creates a generator that returns pairs.
The car of each pair is an exact integer counting up by 1 from 0.
The cdr of each pair is the result of <em>gen</em>.</p>
<p><code>(gpeek </code><em>gen</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a procedure <em>p</em> that behaves like a generator but with more capabilities.
If called with zero arguments, it invokes the underlying generator <em>gen</em>.
However, if called with the argument <code>peek</code>, it retrieves the next value
from <em>gen</em> and returns it, but also saves it in such a way that the
next zero-argument call on <em>p</em> will return it,
analogously to <code>peek-char</code> and <code>peek-u8</code>.
If called with two arguments, <code>poke</code> and an object <em>obj</em>,
it will save <em>obj</em> so that the next zero-argument call on <em>p</em> will return it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling <em>peek</em> after <em>peek</em> will return the same value both times.</li>
<li>Calling <em>poke</em> after <em>poke</em> will make the newer poke overwrite the older poke.</li>
<li>Calling <em>peek</em> after <em>poke</em> will return the latest poke.</li>
<li>Calling <em>poke</em> after <em>peek</em> will overwrite the latest peek with the poke.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>(gchoice </code><em>choice-gen source-gen</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a generator <em>g</em> that behaves as follows:</p>
<p>When <em>g</em> is invoked, it first invokes <em>choice-gen</em> to return an index value <em>i</em>.
It is an error if <em>i</em> is not an exact integer between 0 (inclusive)
and the number of <em>source-gens</em> (exclusive).
Then the <em>i</em>th <em>source-gen</em> is invoked and its value returned by <em>g</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>choice-gen</em> is exhausted, <em>g</em> returns an end of file object.
If the chosen <em>source-gen</em> is exhausted, <em>g</em> remembers that fact
and invokes <em>choice-gen</em> until it returns the index of a <em>source-gen</em>
that has not been exhausted.  When all <em>source-gens</em> are exhausted,
<em>g</em> returns an end of file object.</p>
<p>Composing <code>make-iota-generator</code> and <code>make-circular-generator</code>
from <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-158/srfi-158.html" rel="nofollow">SRFI 158</a>
performs round-robin selection of the <em>source-gens</em>.</p>
<p><code>(stream-&gt;generator </code><em>stream</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a generator that steps through the elements of a SRFI 41 stream.</p>
<p><code>(generator-&gt;stream </code><em>generator</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a SRFI 41 stream containing the values of a generator.</p>
